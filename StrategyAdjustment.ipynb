    "# Modifying Batting Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering modifications to the batting strategy, we are considering a change in the percentage where that pitch count ends the at-bat.  As a result, the modification must leave the sum of pitch counts the same.  Adding (or removing) some amount percentage from a pitch count i-j will then have the opposite effect on all  pitch counts with more balls or more strikes.  Explicitly, labelling the fraction of pitch count i-j as $P(i,j)$, the transformation we are looking at is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P(b,s) \\rightarrow P'(b,s) &= P(b,s) \\pm x\\\\\n",
    "P(i\\ge b, j\\ge s) \\rightarrow P'(i\\ge b, j\\ge s) &= P(i,j)\\left(1 \\mp \\frac{x}{-P(b,s) + \\sum_{i\\ge b, j\\ge s} P(i,j)}\\right),\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(i,j)$ is unchanged if either $i<b$ or $j<s$. For each pitch count we wish to modified, we must calculate the entire transformation.  In particular, we calculate the change in the fractional pitch count $(P'-P)/x$.  This transformation can be written in the form of a 12x12 lower triangular matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P'- P=\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "-1 & 0 & 0 & \\dots\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{P(10)}{1-P(00)} & -1 & 0\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{P(20)}{1-P(00)} & \\frac{P(20)}{1-P(00)-P(10)-P(01)-P(02)-P(11)-P(12)} & -1 &\\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & & & \\ddots\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} \\vec{x}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, for each column in the transformation matrix, the entries are either $0,-1$, or have the same denominator.  This is because the columns denote a shift in one particular pitch count.  It is also important to point out, the pitch count $P(3,2)$ cannot be directly changed, this the entire column is filled with zeros.  This is because there is no state with more balls or strikes that can compensate for the change.  Once you have reached this pitch count, the at-bat will necessarily end at that pitch count."
